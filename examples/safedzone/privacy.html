            <h4>Security of Your Personal Data</h4>
            <p>The security of Your Personal Data is important to Us, but remember that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While We strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect Your Personal Data, We cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>
            <h3>Your California Privacy Rights (California's Shine the Light law)</h3>
            <p>Under California Civil Code Section 1798 (California's Shine the Light law), California residents with an established business relationship with us can request information once a year about sharing their Personal Data with third parties for the third parties' direct marketing purposes.</p>
            <p>If you'd like to request more information under the California Shine the Light law, and if You are a California resident, You can contact Us using the contact information provided below.</p>
            <h3>California Privacy Rights for Minor Users (California Business and Professions Code Section 22581)</h3>
            <p>California Business and Professions Code section 22581 allow California residents under the age of 18 who are registered users of online sites, services or applications to request and obtain removal of content or information they have publicly posted.</p>
            <p>To request removal of such data, and if You are a California resident, You can contact Us using the contact information provided below, and include the email address associated with Your account.</p>
            <p>Be aware that Your request does not guarantee complete or comprehensive removal of content or information posted online and that the law may not permit or require removal in certain circumstances.</p>
            
            <h3>Your rights under the CCPA</h3>
            <p>The California Consumer Privacy Act ("CCPA") grants residents of California certain privacy protections as "consumers", unless a statutory exception applies. You have a number of consumer rights, including the right to access or delete Personal Data collected by a business. To submit a request to access and/or delete your Personal Data if you are a resident of California, please submit an email request to
                <a href="mailto:privacy@safedzone.com">privacy@safedzone.com</a>
            </p>
            <p>
                You also have the right to opt out of a "sale" of your Personal Data. While the CCPA defines "sale" in very broad terms that encompass many commonly occurring data sharing arrangements, transfers to service providers are not considered "sales" as defined under the CCPA. SafeDZone does not sell Personal Data. As set out above we do share some Personal Data with service providers, we do not allow any third party to sell that information.
